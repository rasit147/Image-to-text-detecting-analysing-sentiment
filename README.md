# Image-to-Text Description and Emotion Analysis

# Overview
This project is a Python application that processes an image URL to generate descriptive text using a pre-trained image-to-text model and then analyzes the emotional tone of the generated text. The application categorizes the emotional tone into categories such as happy, sad, or neutral using pre-trained models from Hugging Face.
